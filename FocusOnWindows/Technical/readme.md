### Practical Tips to Improve Your Users Experience
[Jessica Engström](https://twitter.com/EngstromJess)

As humans we have limitations like perception, focus, concentration, distractions you name it. With a simple mindset shift to start recognizing that there is in fact a human with a brain (with all the glory and limitations) on the other end of your solution, the experience for both the user and you will increase enormously. There are hundreds of UX-principles, laws and rules but there often isn't time or resources to study and learn all these. We will look at a few easy steps to improve your UX regardless of if you develop for desktop, web or mobile.
