### What's New in F# 6
[Kathleen Dollard](https://twitter.com/KathleenDollard) [Don Syme](https://twitter.com/dsymetweets) 

F# 6 is all about modernizing and simplifying the experience of learning and using F#.  This applies to the language design, library, performance and tooling. The most significant technical feature in F# 6 is a new mechanism for authoring async tasks that is easier and faster. List and arrays also got faster – in some cases 4 times faster! Language simplification includes more consistent rules for indentation, more implicit conversions, and letting you skip that period between an identifier and the square bracket of an index. You’ll find five new operations on collections and be able to access Keys and Values of a Map. Tooling is also improved  with better performance, pipeline debugging, and better access to C# projects in your solution. Come hear more about F# 6!

### Practical tips to elevate your UX and accessibility
[Jessica Engström](https://twitter.com/EngstromJess) 

As humans we have limitations like perception, focus, concentration, distractions, sight, you name it. 

Adapting our solution to increase the accessibility isn't something we should do as an afterthought or because "someone might have a hard time seeing colors". It's something that we should incorporate from the beginning. 

With a simple mindset shift to start recognizing that there is in fact a human with a brain (with all the glory and limitations) on the other end of your solution, the experience for both the users and you will increase enormously. 
 
There are hundreds of UX-principles, laws and rules but there often isn't time or resources to study and learn all these, especially as developers. 

Jessica will show a few easy steps to start to improve your UX and accessibility regardless of if you develop for desktop, web or mobile.

### Modern Web Applications with SAFE Stack
[Isaac Abraham](https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham) 

The SAFE stack is an free, open-source, flexible end-to-end, functional-first stack for cloud-ready web applications that emphasizes type-safe programming. It allows you to develop web applications almost entirely in F#, without needing to compromise and shoehorn your codebase into an object-oriented framework or library, and without needing you to be an expert in CSS or HTML to create compelling, rich client-side web applications.

This talk will demonstrate the value proposition behind the SAFE Stack, illustrating how we can develop unified client / server applications that take the best features of F# and apply them throughout the stack - such as type safety, succinctness, productivity and performance - whilst still integrating naturally with technologies and frameworks such as ASP .NET, JavaScript and React.

You'll see how to create data driven server-side APIs quickly and easily, and then surface those APIs in a rich, responsive web application running in the browser, using a combination of .NET and JavaScript libraries and tools that come together beautifully. Lastly, we'll see how easily SAFE apps can be hosted on a cloud platform such as Microsoft Azure.

### Blazor and GraphQL
[Poornima Nayar](https://twitter.com/PoornimaNayar) 

GraphQL is a powerful way of querying data. Creating loosely coupled clients using various JavaScript libraries to present data from a GraphQL API has been a popular architecture adopted by developers. How can we consume an GraphQL API in a Blazor WASM app to create rich apps? What if I can make it even better by using the content from a Headless CMS and present it using a Blazor App? In my session, I will make use of the GraphQL API from Umbraco Heartcore, a headless CMS, to create a Harry Potter themed Blazor App and present the data to the user in multiple ways.

### Understanding Microservices: a guide for the monolithic developer
[Layla Porter](https://twitter.com/laylacodesit) 

Microservice Architecture and the reasons why you should move to it, and the reasons you shouldn't, have been well discussed.
If you have already decided to move over to microservices from monolithic development, then you may be finding the whole process a bit daunting.
What aspects should you, a developer be concerned with?
What does all the terminology mean?
How do the services talk to each other?
In this session, I will show you how to get started with microservices architecture, answering these questions and many more.
We'll look at The Tanzu Tacos project, built with ASP.NET 5, and explore how the whole process fits together from a development point of view.
Hopefully, you'll leave the session with the confidence to start your own microservices application development straight away!

### OSS NuGet Package Explorer: From WPF to WinUI and running in Browser
[Jérôme Laban](https://twitter.com/jlaban) 

NuGet Package Explorer (NPE) is a client for browsing NuGet packages from an online feed and viewing contents of the packages. Traditionally constrained to Windows use-cases because of its WPF code base it could not be used on all platforms where .net developers are active on – i.e. using Visual Studio Code on Linux or Visual Studio for Mac on macOS.

To help widen NPE reach to all developers we ported it to Web (www.nuget.info)  - and would love to show you how we did it using WinUI, Windows Community Toolkit and Uno Platform. After attending this talk, you will understand the option Uno Platform gives you for getting C# and XAML codebase to run in the browser, and all other desktop and mobile platforms.

### Using, and creating, custom project templates in Visual Studio and the dotnet CLI
[Sayed Hashimi](https://twitter.com/sayedihashimi) 

Creating project templates is a great way to make it easy for users to get started from a common starting point. In the past it was difficult to create, and maintain, project templates for .NET. Now it's very easy to get started with your own custom project templates. You can create a project template that can be used in the command line with dotnet new, Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio for Mac. Come to this talk to see how easy it is to create your very own project templates. We will cover creating single project templates as well as solution templates that contain several projects.

### Building High Performance Systems with Akka.Streams
[Aaron Stannard](https://twitter.com/Aaronontheweb) 

One of the most common scaling problems in any high-throughput system occurs when a producer of data is able to emit events far faster than they can be consumed, eventually resulting in the system "tipping over" as a result of buffer overflows or pegged CPUs.

The goal behind the Reactive Streams initiative (http://www.reactive-streams.org/) is to help provide a means of non-blocking back-pressuring these producer-consumer relationships across service and process boundaries. 

In this talk, we're going to learn how to use Akka.Streams, an implementation of the Reactive Streams specification built on top of Akka.NET, to take advantage of this design inside our own applications. We'll learn about how to design a fully connected Akka.Streams Graph, how to use built-in graph stages, how to implement our own custom graph stages, and some best practices and use cases for working with Akka.Streams in production.
