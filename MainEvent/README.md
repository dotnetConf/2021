.NET Conf is a free, three-day, virtual developer event that celebrates the major releases of the .NET development platform. It is co-organized by the .NET community and Microsoft, and sponsored by the .NET Foundation and our ecosystem partners. A huge THANK YOU to all who tuned in live, asked questions in our twitter feed and participated in our fun and games. Don't forget to get your free digital swag!

Watch the sessions on demand on the [.NET YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVFtp9MDEBNbA2sSqYvXSXO) and [MS Learn](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2021/).

# Community-run Events
Communities across the world self-organize local .NET Conf events every year to help spread the word about the .NET releases. These events can be virtual or in-person depending on your local area health and safety guidelines. The .NET Foundation is supporting community-run virtual events again this year through their virtual meetup group. We will advertize your community event on the main event website, YouTube and social.

# Event Guidelines
You are free to organize a presentation, workshop, or hack-a-thon anytime after the main event broadcast until January 31, 2022.

The technical content needs to be .NET related and preferably on .NET 6. Topics can include but aren't limited to: ASP.NET, .NET MAUI, Windows, Visual Studio family, C#/F#/Visual Basic, Azure, ML .NET, Entity Framework, .NET open source projects. Basically, anything .NET-related! You can also choose to redeliver any of the content from the show, with proper attribution to the original speakers. 

# Technical Content
Session decks will be found in the [`Technical`](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotNETConf/tree/master/2021/MainEvent/Technical) folder as we receive them from speakers.

# Creative & Social Copy 
The [`Creative`](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotNETConf/tree/master/2021/MainEvent/Creative) folder contains creative banners and images you can use to advertise .NET Conf and your own community events. There are a variety of sizes to choose from. You may use any of these banners to advertize the main event itself, or your events in your community. You may add your local meetup name, location and dates to these images. Please do not change the .NET Conf branding.
